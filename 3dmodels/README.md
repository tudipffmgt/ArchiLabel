# 3D Models

<img src="figure-3dmodel.png" height="250">

In the provided 3D models, most of the architectural elements are separate objects that were labeled with respective AAT or Wikidata ids following the pattern `<englishName>_wd:<wikidataId>_aat:<aatId>_<number>`, (e.g. `arch_wd:Q12277_aat:300000994_003`) which allows parsing the identifiers of the AAT and Wikidata.
Some objects are grouped to form a more general entity resulting in a hierarchy of elements.

The 3D models are provided as FBX and XML-based Collada file.
Due to their size, the files are provided via a separate file hosting service.
